# MiRuś

<p><b>MiRuś</b> is an Arduino UNO based mobile robot project designed only for entertainment purposes only (so far). It's outer shell design is based on Mobile Industrial Robots' <i>MiR200</i>, however it is scaled down by over a half MiR's size. It is not designed to carry any load neither to perform any tasks or missions.</p>

## Features

### Wandering

<p>As it was mentioned before, project's sole purpose is show-off entertainment thus It's movement capabiities are narrow. Arduino code of MiRus only allows him to drive in a straight line mindlessly until detection of an obstacle in certain range.</p>

### Colision prevention

<p>When an obstacle is detected, the robot turns by a random angle to have a clear path, or stays motionless when obstacle was detected too close.</p>

### PID control

<p>To make sure the robot drives in a straight line the robot drives by simplified version of PID regulator</p>
